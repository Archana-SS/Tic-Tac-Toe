* Board Class (Board.java)

* Manages the game grid.

* Creates an n x n board filled with a default symbol (e.g., '-').

1) Player Class (Player.java):

* Stores and manages player information such as:

* Name, age, address, contact number, email, and game symbol (X or O).

* Includes methods to set and retrieve player details and symbols.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Game Class (Game.java):

* Read player move input.

* Validate positions.

* Check for winning conditions across rows, columns, and both diagonals.

* Launching the game loop via the Game class.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸŽ® Game Flow:-
